- add error.ts files for fallback because even the panel errors fallback to the default root error page.
- create an error dump file for production, for now it is console.error only.

header:
- fix the responsiveness and make the burger button work. Will need a drawer on small screens. 
- remove anasayfa and add Hakkimizda instead.
- change the logo and make clickable for homepage
- why is onAuthStateChanged called 3 times on every useEffect execution?

panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)

actions:
- revise cookie (need restriction for binge requests, and accurate error return) 
- revise if any action should be called within a startTransition

token expiration:
- token expires when site is left for a while, so when admin panel is directly opened, it will first redirect to homepage and then refresh token.

loginpage:
- login page is reachable for logged in users, restrict it.

admin:
  navbar ui:
  -hide the navbar for small devices? (low priority)
  courses ui:
  -check responsiveness
  -radio buttons look ugly within accordion
  -edit symbol is not explanatory enough
  -add toggle for visibility in the homepage
  -modal ui needs refactoring
  courses:
  -add delete function but only allow it if it is not connected to a student schedule, consider making it 'legacy' if it is connected to a student schedule
   consider if 'visibility' is required if 'legacy' is implemented
  -consider adding server side props for initial courses state (route segment config on nextjs docs: getStaticProps equivalent of app router)
  -modal will throw error if courses state is an empty array. Must fix.
  -sort courses by dateCreated (or id desc?)
  -render modals conditionally (flush states on close)
