ui:
 homepage:
- edit picture of seminar

 hakkimizda:
- edit teacher bio
- edit company bio
- add photos to the carousel


bugs:
- problem with reading storage after login


student panel:
 bugs:
- throws to homepage after refresh (tested in newly registered, session storage)
- ui rendering problem that happened some time ago?


------


bugs not to be bothered with:
-'show more' button in admin page is not disabled when there's factors of exactly 5 items (would cause overhead to db query if fixed)
-in admin page wrong radio button might appear to be selected when the list items are changed
-students list with more than 5 is not tested yet, 'show more' in students is yet to be tested

SEE LATER:

header:
- why is onAuthStateChanged called 3 times on every useEffect execution?

panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)
  will need to try GET request for unauthorized access to admin panel, to see whether the first render is allowed within admin/layout.tsx

token expiration:
- token expires when site is left for a while, so when admin panel is directly opened, it will first redirect to homepage and then refresh token.
