- add error.ts files for fallback because even the panel errors fallback to the default root error page.

- get rid of throw new Error() and change them to return; from functions instead.

header:
- why is onAuthStateChanged called 3 times on every useEffect execution?
- logout button doesn't clear local storage but clears cookies.

ui:
 drawer:
- change dark mode slider indicator color

 homepage:
- check stats initial high-gap issue on small device when in production
- change min-h-screen to min-h-dvh
- mention certification?
- 'egitim detaylari' button below course cards

 hakkimizda:
- plan layout
- teacher photo and bio
- class photo? (preferably with students)
- company history/description?

  iletisim:
- decide whether to keep the same email
- flex-col title and main, vertically center for visual improvement
  footer:
- add copyright


panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)
  will need to try GET request for unauthorized access to admin panel, to see whether the first render is allowed within admin/layout.tsx

actions:
- throttling? debouncing?
  incorporate rate limiting to setCookies, deleteCookies, auth checkers?, and loggers called from client (within middleware? using lru-cache? (for in-memory storage?))
  maybe limit rate to all actions and api routes?
- revise if any action should be called within a startTransition

token expiration:
- token expires when site is left for a while, so when admin panel is directly opened, it will first redirect to homepage and then refresh token.

loginpage:
- login page is reachable for logged in users, restrict it.

admin:
 - will need pagination for every admin page, to prevent overloading.

  courses:
  -warn when making legacy
  -test with empty list

  -update periods list after removing (the single last one i removed was still there)
  -warn when deleting
  -change outdated periods' color to orange
