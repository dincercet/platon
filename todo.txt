- add error.ts files for fallback because even the panel errors fallback to the default root error page.
- create an error dump file for production, for now it is console.error only.

header:
- fix the responsiveness and make the burger button work. Will need a drawer on small screens. 

panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)
