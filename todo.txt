- add error.ts files for fallback because even the panel errors fallback to the default root error page.
- add loading state for fetching data

- get rid of throw new Error() and change them to return; from functions instead.

header:
- why is onAuthStateChanged called 3 times on every useEffect execution?
- logout button doesn't clear local storage but clears cookies.

panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)
  will need to try GET request for unauthorized access to admin panel, to see whether the first render is allowed within admin/layout.tsx

actions:
- throttling? debouncing?
  incorporate rate limiting to setCookies, deleteCookies, auth checkers?, and loggers called from client (within middleware? using lru-cache? (for in-memory storage?))
  maybe limit rate to all actions and api routes?
- revise if any action should be called within a startTransition

token expiration:
- token expires when site is left for a while, so when admin panel is directly opened, it will first redirect to homepage and then refresh token.

loginpage:
- login page is reachable for logged in users, restrict it.

admin:
 - will need pagination for every admin page, to prevent overloading.

  courses:
  -test with empty list

  curriculums:
  -curriculums[selectedCurriculum] is undefined when the last item of curriculums is deleted (none of the items becomes selected so 'remove' button throws error (after isCurriculumSelected &&))
  -test with empty list

  periods:
  -update periods list after removing (the single last one i removed was still there)
  -change outdated periods' color to orange
  -test with empty list

  students:
  -test remove student
  -test with empty list

- you used localstorage for passing email in download/getDocuments (admin and student panel), adjust it to whichever storage is used
