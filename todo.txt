- add error.ts files for fallback because even the panel errors fallback to the default root error page.
- add loading state for fetching data

-return error messages from server in Turkish, and display them in UI as a seperate text field.
 get rid of throw new Error() and change them to return; from functions instead.

header:
- fix the responsiveness and make the burger button work. Will need a drawer on small screens.
- why is onAuthStateChanged called 3 times on every useEffect execution?
- logout button doesn't clear local storage but clears cookies.

panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)

actions:
- throttling? debouncing?
  incorporate rate limiting to setCookies, deleteCookies, auth checkers?, and loggers called from client (within middleware? using lru-cache? (for in-memory storage?))
  maybe limit rate to all actions and api routes?
- revise if any action should be called within a startTransition

token expiration:
- token expires when site is left for a while, so when admin panel is directly opened, it will first redirect to homepage and then refresh token.

loginpage:
- login page is reachable for logged in users, restrict it.

admin:
  courses:
  -add delete function but only allow it if it is not connected to a student period, make it 'legacy' if it is connected to a student period
  -consider adding server side props for initial courses state (route segment config on nextjs docs: getStaticProps equivalent of app router)

  -sort by id descending
  -group by legacy
  -change color if legacy

  -test with empty list
  -add course modal: disable add button if form variables empty
  -edit course modal: disable edit button if form isTouched false

  curriculums:
  -change color if legacy
  -add delete function if there is no students, make it legacy if there are students
  -every curriculum can only have one course. When adding a new curriculum, check if the chosen course has a non-legacy curriculum, if there is, require to make the existing curriculum legacy
   maybe just exclude courses that have a non-legacy curriculum when adding new curriculum

  -add delete last week function

  -sort by newest and display whether legacy
  -add new curriculum modal: sort the courses by newest and exclude legacy

  periods:
  -add period modal: disable add button in modal when form isTouched false
   exclude legacy curriculums
   sort fetched curriculums by id descending

  -edit period modal: disable edit button in modal when form isTouched false, and change the title of modal
  -sort by beginning date (newest first)
  -test with empty list

  students:
  -sort the students by newest
  -sort periods by beginning date (newest first)

  -add student modal: sort periods by beginning date (newest first)
  -edit periods modal: sort fetchedPeriods by beginning date (newest first)

  -test remove student
  -implement button to resend email sign up link (later if needed)

you used localstorage for passing email in download/getDocuments (admin and student panel), adjust it to whichever storage is used
