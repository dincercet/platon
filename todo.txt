- add error.ts files for fallback because even the panel errors fallback to the default root error page.
- create an error dump file for production, for now it is console.error only.

header:
- fix the responsiveness and make the burger button work. Will need a drawer on small screens. 
- remove anasayfa and add Hakkimizda instead.
- change the logo and make clickable for homepage

panel:
- check if the container component causes the layout.tsx to be rendered on the client. (security risk)

actions:
- revise cookie (need restriction for binge requests, and accurate error return) 

form validations:
try without error Text fields and with form.isValid() and change others (loginform, editcourse) if it works in AddCourseModal component
